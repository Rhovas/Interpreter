# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please note that Rhovas is still a
pretty new language and largely a one-person project, however there are two main
ways you can contribute:

 - Try writing example programs in Rhovas (the [Online Editor](https://rhovas.dev/editor/)
   may help here) and provide feedback to help improve the language. Feel free
   to ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/gm96xd8) if you're not sure how to
   accomplish something or come across a bug.
    - If you're looking for ideas we have a [RosettaCode page](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Rhovas)
      that's a little short on solutions. We also use these as test cases that
      represent practical programs, so it helps in that way too!
 - For code contributions, you're welcome to work on any open issue or propose
   something new if there's a feature you're waiting on. In general, please make
   sure to keep me (`@WillBAnders`) in the loop so I know what's being worked on
   and can provide guidance along the way - communication is key!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gm96xd8).
