<!--
BEFORE opening a PR, please confirm the following:
 - You've discussed this PR with me (@WillBAnders), e.g. via Discord.
 - In general, there is an open issue for the associated bug/feature.

WHEN opening a PR, please do the following:
 - Include a meaningful description of your code change, particularly around
   key areas like bugfix solution and design decisions.
 - Ensure there are tests added covering your changes.
 - Link any associated open issue for the associated bug/feature.
 - Enable "Allow edits from maintainers", which allows me to make changes on
   your branch. This is mainly intended for final nitpicks like styling or test
   coverage, but also allows me to finish PRs (and give credit for said changes)
   if they end up abandoned.

AFTER opening a PR, please do the following:
 - Keep an eye out for comments/reviews and respond in a timely fashion.
 - If I'm behind on comments/reviews (say a few days), tag me on Discord as a
   reminder (I normally respond quickly, but forget to circle back later on).
