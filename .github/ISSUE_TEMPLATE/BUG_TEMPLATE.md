<!--
BEFORE opening an issue, please confirm the following:
 - There is not an open (or closed) issue for this bug.
 - There is not a fixed merged and awaiting release (the online editor will
   generally not have the latest commits).
 - If you're unsure please ask me (@WillBAnders) via Discord.

WHEN opening an issue, please do the following:
 - Include a meaningful description of the bug and the expected behavior.
 - Include an example program that can be used to reproduce the bug.

AFTER opening an issue, please do the following:
 - Keep an eye out for comments and respond in a timely fashion, particularly
   regarding clarifying information needed to triage the issue.
 - If your issue has not been triaged (say after a few days), tag me on Discord
   as a reminder. I will try to keep the issue updated on status, but fixing the
   bug itself may take time.
    - I will _not_ close issues as stale so long as I can reproduce it.
